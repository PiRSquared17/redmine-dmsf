#summary Guide how to migrate from Documents to DMSF.

There is rake task ready for migration from default Redmine Documents module to DMSF. Example:
 {{{ rake redmine:dmsf_convert_documents RAILS_ENV="production" }}}

This is the default invocation. It goes through all projects and all those having Documents module active and DMSF inactive are converted.

Conversion of each project:
 # Activates DMSF for project
 # Creates folder for each document in Document module
 # Creates file for each document attachment in corresponding folder
 # All descriptions are transfered to DMSF
 # Redmine's Documents module is deactivated

There are several options to task:
 * project => _id_ or _identifier_ of project (defaults to all projects)
 * dry => _true_ or _false_ (default _false_) to perform just check without any conversion
 * invalid=replace => to perform document title invalid characters replacement for '-'

Another example for testing conversion:
 {{{ rake redmine:dmsf_convert_documents project=test dry=true RAILS_ENV="production" }}}

*Always backup your current content before you try to convert content!*
